# Brain JS (Scrimba course)

## How they learn - Structure

```JS
// inputs & outputs
(inputs) => outputs; // receive inputs as an arguments and produce outputs

// random values
Math.random(); // begins with the banch of random outputs

// The output is a random at first. It somewhere between 0 and 1

// activation "relu"
function relu(value) {
  return value < 0 ? 0 : value;
}

// In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node, or "neuron," given an input or set of inputs. This output is then used as input for the next node and so on until a desired solution to the original problem is found.
